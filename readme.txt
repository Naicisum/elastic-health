Elastic Health

The intent of this is to produce one or more scripts that will interrogate
elasticsearch using the existing REST API. The output from these calls will be
re-parsed into a more manageable format and hopefully provide meaningful
output for troubleshooting potential issues with applications using elastic-
search as well as issues within elasticsearch itself.
